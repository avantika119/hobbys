    <h1 style="color: white; font-family: fantasy; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-family: fantasy; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">My favorite hobby is Art. Art is more than just a pastime or a creative outlet; it is a hobby that has helped me discover more about myself and the world around me.
     In this blog My Hobby Is Art, I will share my personal experiences as an art hobbyist and explore the various benefits of engaging in art as a hobby.
     <br>
     My hobby of drawing started when I was 5. At first, I was just using colors to paint.
      I used just to draw some random pictures. I used to draw something every day.
       That is how I developed my drawing skills. I used to take part in various competitions. 
       I was very interested in taking part in multiple events. I won lots of medals, trophies, and certificates by taking participate in these kinds of competitions and events.
        Apart from that, when I improved my skill, I started painting for others. I used to draw for my friends, cousins, and family members. I used to participate in school events. 
        I was popular among my friends in my school days. Everyone wanted to make drawing for them. It gave me more motivation to do something new and to upgrade my skill.
        <br>
        I love drawing because it gave me respect. It made me popular among my friends. 
        One of the major reasons why I love drawing because it gives me wings to fly.
         I can draw anything which is in my mind. I can express my thoughts through drawing. 
         I draw various things. I draw for a social cause. I draw about the current situation.
          I love drawing because I can speak through my drawing and painting without uttering a word.
           I love drawing because this hobby is my favorite timepass. I draw in every mood. It helps me put my emotions on the canvas. 
           Whenever I feel low or sad, I just put my sketchbook out from the cupboard and start drawing anything, whatever in my mind. People call it freestyle painting, 
           it means without any purpose. After that, I feel very satisfied.
