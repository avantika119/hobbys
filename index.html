      <h1 style="color:white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy;">My Favorite Hobby</h1>
      <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20px;">My favorite hobby is Dancing. I love to dance, more specifically I love to do ballet. 
        There is never a day that passes where I don't do something ballet related, like actually going to class, or on my “off days,” dancing around in my kitchen waiting for my chicken nuggets to become golden brown.
         I have been through some arduous times with ballet, but it is what helped me learn to become a better dancer. If there is one thing I would let anyone know about ballet, regardless if they are just starting or professional, 
         is that it is nearly impossible to reach your maximum skill capacity if you compare yourself to other people.</p>
         <br>
<p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20px;">
I started dancing since I was about three years old, so that means I have been dancing for about twelve years. Starting this September, I will finally accomplish being in the highest level in my ballet studio. 
It took many years to get there and loads of patience, so after many trials and tribulations, I weaved my way to the top. Every year in order to prepare myself for the new group I am going to be in, I take summer intensive classes which are exactly what they sound like. 
They are two to four grueling weeks in the middle of summer where you put all of your patience and skill to perfect your technique for the oncoming year.
 Of course, I was going to take the summer intensive this year to prepare myself for the new year.
