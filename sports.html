<h1 style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20px;">My Favorite Hobby</h1>
<p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20px;">My favorite hobby is Football. Football is my hobby because it is a part of my life and I can't live without it.
     Living in a country like Germany, football is the king of sport. 
     That's why it is not surprising that my childhood has grown with the soccer ball until today. 
     My mom told me that I liked to kick the ball and I had a lot of fun when I had an age of only about three years.
      Since that time, playing football is my favorite sport, and it is my hobby when I am free. It's interesting and surprising, especially the feeling when I score a goal or when my teammates do it. 
      That feeling fills me as if I just filed something very important. Playing football also helps me relax and have confidence when I have stress and frustration. For a moment, after doing a task or studying all day, I feel tired and exhausted.
       However, having fun with the ball, like kicking it against the wall or trying to do some tricks, all my fatigue and exhaustion disappear. In addition, Football is not only about passing and kicking the ball, it also requires a lot of reflection and some basic skills. </p>

       <p style="color: white; text-align: center; font-family: fantasy; font-size: 20px;">Besides that, football also taught me the spirit of teamwork and created a strong sporting capacity in me. However, I do not only like to play football but I also enjoy watching football games on television.
         Football is very popular all over the world today. Especially, in the World Cup season, I am very excited to see the games in which many famous teams like Brazil, Germany, England, Spain, Holland, etc. And my favorite team is Italy.
         I am very happy when Italy wins, but I will get angry and I will not sleep well that night if they lose.</p>
